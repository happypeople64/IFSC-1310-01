    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
        Web Accessibility is the having easy access to navigate the web. This is important for people that may have certain disabilites that make it hard for them to easily
        navigate the internet or just an operating system. It may be easy for me to navigate a website without having to change the settings, but for others it may not be 
        that easy. If there isn't any accessibilty settings then it maybe hard if not impossible for others.
